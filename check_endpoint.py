post_content = """I found this crazy report called the India Salary Guide 2023.

86% of all respondents across every industry, age group, market and seniority level are planning to switch jobs.

38% of all current employees have not worked in their current role for more than 2 years.

This report issued by Michael Page has the full range of minimum, average and maximum salaries across functions and types of companies in:

Finance, Engineering, Manufacturing, Accounting, Healthcare, HR, Legal, Compliance, Procurement, Construction, Sales & Marketing - all across various industries and positions varying by seniority.

If youâ€™re looking to switch, this is a phenomenal guide for you to get a sense of where the employee market is at.

Though one disclaimer - this report was published in the beginning of the year. A lot has changed with the startups of the country in layoffs since then. So take that into account, but this is great data to have.
